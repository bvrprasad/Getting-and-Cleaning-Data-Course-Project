### Introduction
This repository is created for the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project".
It contains the following files:
- README.md      # this file
- run_analysis.R # R program for the data analysis

### Pre-requisites
The samsung data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
should be available as unzipped in the directory where this program will be run.

### Usage of run_analysis.R
Run this file from within R studio as follows:
> source("run_analysis.R")

This program does the following:
1. creates a new working directory: wrk-<Date>, where Date is the FullISO date of current timestamp
2. copies the files to work with from Samsung directory to the working directory
3. appends the relevant training and test data files using file.append() and creates new files to work with
4. reads the files using readLines()
5. converts the read lines to relevant R objects
6. merges X, y, activity and subject
7. extracts only the mean and std measures plus the activity and subject into a new data frame
8. merges the Activity.Name from activity_labels with the above data frame
9. using melt() and dcast the means of various measures are calculated grouped by Activity and Subject
10. The output is stored in the file called "tidyDF.txt" in the working directory
